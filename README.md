# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis

As part of this project, we used several techniques to evaluate and train models on credit card credit datasets from LendingClub. We used the imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate our models using resampling.

The RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms were used to oversample the data, followed by the ClusterCentroids algorithm to undersample it. A combinatorial method of over- and undersampling was also used, using the SMOTEENN algorithm. 

Next, we applied two machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, to predict credit risk. The models were evaluated based on their accuracy and confusion matrices.
